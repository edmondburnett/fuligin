Design philosophy
---

- Pure C++ w/standard library only, commonly available on most devices, zero other dependencies.
- Highly portable, can be compiled virtually anywhere with minimal fuss.
- Can be built and viewed from low-power and potentially primitive devices.
- Templates and generated files utilize pure open web standards.
- Simple, enjoyable, and calming to maintain; should be able to walk away for a year and come back to an immediate, fully-working project without a broken environment or dependencies etc (looking at you, npm).
