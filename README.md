fuligin
===
An idiosyncratic static wiki engine / site generator (WIP).

> "Furthermore, the hue fuligin, which is darker than black, admirably erases all folds, bunchings and gatherings so far as the eye is concerned, showing only a featureless dark." -- Gene Wolfe, The Shadow of the Torturer


Design philosophy
---

- Single binary static generator.
- Pure C++ w/standard library only, commonly available on most general computing devices, zero other dependencies.
- Highly portable, can be compiled virtually anywhere with minimal fuss.
- Can be built, hosted, and viewed from low-power, air-gapped, and potentially primitive devices.
- Templates and generated files utilize pure open web standards.
- Simple, enjoyable, and calming to maintain; should be able to walk away for an extended period of time and come back to an immediate, fully-working project without a broken environment or dependencies etc (i.e., npm).
- Generated sites can be run and worked on fully-offline with no offsite queries.
