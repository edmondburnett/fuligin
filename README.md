fuligin
===
An idiosyncratic static wiki engine / site generator (WIP).

> "Furthermore, the hue fuligin, which is darker than black, admirably erases all folds, bunchings and gatherings so far as the eye is concerned, showing only a featureless dark." -- Gene Wolfe, The Book of The New Sun


Design philosophy
---

- Single binary static generator.
- Pure C++, commonly available on most general computing devices, no outside dependencies.
- Can be built, hosted, and viewed from low-power, air-gapped devices.
- Templating may be esoteric, but all generated output utilizes pure open web standards, with no JavaScript.
- Simple, enjoyable, and calming to maintain; should be able to walk away for an extended period of time and come back to an immediate, fully-working project without a broken environment or dependencies etc (i.e., npm).
